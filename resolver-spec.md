# JSPM Resolver Specification

This page is the primary specification of the jspm 2.0 NodeJS-compatible resolver.

The jspm resolver specified here is now fully compatible with the NodeJS resolution algorithm,
while the SystemJS browser resolver which allows custom browser resolution configuration is specified at the SystemJS project
page at https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/blob/0.20.14/docs/production-build.md#resolution-algorithm.

jspm 2.0 separates the browser and NodeJS resolvers into two separate resolvers since one of the greatest points of difficulty with jspm before the 2.0 version was the lack of support for the NodeJS module resolution system. As a result, the goal of trying to support a unified universal browser and NodeJS resolver has been abandoned.

## jspm Resolver Principles

All module names in the WhatWG loader are treated as URLs with the encoding rules that apply. When using an ES module loader running in NodeJS, [`file:///` URLs](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2006/12/06/file-uris-in-windows/) are the preferable way to maintain compatilibity, to ensure that the handling of resolution and encoding cases is shared between the browser and Node.

For the purposes of practicality though, the jspm NodeJS resolution algorithm is specified as a specification on paths, just like the NodeJS module resolution algorithm.

The idea here is that normalization from URL into path space is handled as a pre-resolution transform on the specifier which is defined in the main resolver algorithm here, before returning the correct valid absolute file path for the system.

### Plain Names

`plain names` or `bare names` as they are referred to in the WhatWG loader specification are module names
that do not start with `/` or `./` or `../` and do not parse as valid URLs.

Plain names are the module names that run through multiple remapping phases, although absolute URL names can be remapped as well
through contextual relative map configuration.

### Distinguishing between jspm Modules and Node Modules

The jspm resolver relies on the ability to know whether a given module path should be treated as a jspm module or a NodeJS module in order to provide full compatibility.

This detection is based on detecting both a `package.json` and a `jspm.json` jspm configuration as indicating a jspm package boundary, and a `node_modules` folder as indicating a NodeJS package boundary. The jspm package boundary then extends from the `package.json` configuration file folder through all subfolders, stopping at any `node_modules` subfolders. When a nested jspm configuration is found, the nested configuration take precedence over the lower-level configuration, only if the nested jspm boundary `package.json` file folder path does not exactly correspond to a package path of the parent project. Modules without a `jspm.json` and `package.json` combination in all their parent folder paths are treated as NodeJS modules.

### jspm Config File

The `jspm.json` jspm configuration file stores dependency and resolution information associated with the a jspm project.

The full jspm configuration file will have its own specification page in future. For the resolver, the following
properties are the only ones which affect the jspm resolution for a module:

`jspm.json`:
```js
{
  // Top-level resolutions
  "resolve": {
    [name: Relative | Plain]: Relative | Plain | PackageName | Conditional
  },
  // Installed dependency (contextual) configurations
  "dependencies": {
    [exactName: ExactPackageName]: {
      // Contextual dependency resolutions
      "resolve": {
        [name: Relative | Plain]: Relative | Plain | PackageName | Conditional
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In addition the following constraint is placed:

> Package-relative resolutions (starting with `./`) can only resolve to other package-relative resolutions.

This is in order to avoid recursive mapping cases and ensure a well-defined single-pass resolver.

The above type definitions are:

* `Relative`: A string `s`, `/`-separated (if any), starting with `./` or equal to `.`.
* `Plain`: A string `s` satisfying `isPlainName(s)`.
* `PackageName`: A string `s` satisfying `isPackageName(s)`.
* `Conditional`: An object of type `{ [ConditionName]: Relative | Plain | PackageName }`, where `ConditionName` is a string with value `"browser" | "node" | "dev" | "production" | "default"` corresponding to the environment setting. The `"default"` environment conditional is always `true`, and additional environment conditionals may be suported in future.

When these configuration type assertions are broken, the configuration is considered invalid, and the entire resolution will
abort on the assertion error.

The resolve object is a map configuration that replaces the best matched starting prefix of the name.

Condition maps are object maps setting resolutions based on environment conditionals. These conditions are checked in property order on the object with the first matching environment conditional corresponding to the replacement resolution string. For example, a package.json browser property:

```js
{
  "browser": {
    "./x": "./y"
  }
}
```

can be represented by a conditional resolve as:

```js
resolve: {
  "./x": {
    "browser": "./y"
  }
}
```

these resolve values themselves are originally set from reading the dependency package.json files as packages are installed.

### Package.json Configuration

The following package.json properties affect the resolution process (this is not a comprehensive spec of the jspm package.json properties):

`package.json`:
```js
{
  "directories": {
    "lib": RelOrPlain,
    "dist": RelOrPlain
  },
  "configFiles": {
    "jspm": RelOrPlain
  }
}
```

* `directories.lib`: Configures the default `parentUrl` (`baseUrl`) path under the `dev` environment conditional. Defaults to `"."`.
* `directories.dist`: Configures the default `parentUrl` (`baseUrl`) path under the `production` environment conditional. Defaults to the value of `lib`.
* `configFiles.jspm`: The path to the `jspm.json` file. Defaults to `"jspm.json"`.

The jspm packages folder is taken to be the `jspm_packages` folder within the folder containing the `package.json` file. If this `jspm_packages` folder does not exist, then this folder is set to the system global jspm_packages folder (global cache). This folder is typically located at `~/.jspm/jspm_packages` in posix environments, and at the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\.jspm\jspm_packages` path in Windows, and can be customized by setting the `JSPM_GLOBAL_PATH` environment variable.

## Algorithms

All URL operations here are handled exactly as in the WhatWG URL specification, including the handling of encodings and errors.

Any error in any operation, including assertion errors, should be fully propagated as a top-level resolve error abrupt completion.

### Path Resolution

Module specifiers are considered relative URLs, so obey URL encoding and normalization rules.

This specification handles resolution in path space, including handling of `.` and `..` internal segments, converting `\\` into `/` for the resolution process, before outputting a valid pathname for the environment with the correct separator at the end of resolution. Valid absolute paths are well-formed file paths of the target file system with the correct separator being used.

The reason for this is that resolution in URL space with mappings results in moving between spaces as maps are in path-space, while resolution is in URL space. The first iteration of the resolver was written entirely in URL space, but converted into path space for performance and simplicity.

The resolution algorithm handles converting the import specifier name through URL-space conversions. As an example of the kinds of issues that need to be handled converting between URL and path spaces:

```js
import './ðŸŽ‰\\x%20.js';
```

would normalize into the URL `file:///parent/path/%F0%9F%8E%89/%20%2F.js` (which would also be the module name as stored in the module registry running a module loader in NodeJS), representing the file path `/parent/path/ðŸŽ‰/x .js` on the file system.

In addition, encodings of `/` and `\\` (`%2F` and `%5C`) are not permitted as file path encodings for security, and will throw when attempting to access the file system.

To match URL resolution behaviours, `/c:/path` and `//\\c:\\path` will resolve absolutely into `file:///c:/path`, while `c:\\path` will resolve to an invalid `c:` protocol and `//c:/path` will fail resolution.

### Plain Name Detection

This detection is exactly as in the [WhatWG module resolution detection](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#resolve-a-module-specifier):

> **IS_PLAIN(name: String): boolean**
> 1. If _name_ parses as a valid URL then return _false_.
> 1. Otherwise if _name_ begins with _"/"_, _"./"_ or _"../"_ then return _false_.
> 1. Otherwise return _true_.

### Relative Name Detection

Relative names are determined by the algorithm:

> **IS_RELATIVE(name: String): boolean**
> 1. If _name_ begins with _"./"_ return _true_.
> 1. Otherwise return _false_.

### Package Name Detection

Package names in canonical form are names of the form `registry:package@version`.

Valid package names satisfy the JS regular expression:

```js
/^[a-z]+:[@\-_\.a-zA-Z\d][-_\.a-zA-Z\d]*(\/[-_\.a-zA-Z\d]+)*@[^\/\\]+$/
```

Any characters are supported in versions except for `\`, `/`. Version tags that do contain these characters
must rely on custom encoding of these cases by the registry implementation. Each registry can have its own more restrictive requirements for sanitization of package names and versions as well.

A package called `registry:package@version` in jspm is stored in `/path/to/jspm_packages/registry/package@version/`.

To convert a package between these forms, the following methods are defined:

> **PARSE_PACKAGE_CANONICAL(canonical: String): { name: String, path: String }**
> 1. Let _name_ be the unique substring of _name_ starting from the first index, that satisfies the package name regular expression.
> 1. If _name_ is _undefined_ then,
>    1. Return _undefined_.
> 1. Let _path_ be the substring of _canonical_ starting from the index of the length of _name_.
> 1. If _path_ is not the empty string and does not start with _"/"_
>    1. Return _undefined_.
> 1. Return the object with values _{ name, path }_.

> **PARSE_PACKAGE_PATH(path: String, jspmPackagesPath: String): { name: String, path: String }**
> 1. Assert _jspmPackagesPath_ is a valid file system path.
> 1. Assert _jspmPackagesPath_ ends with the path segment _"jspm_packages"_.
> 1. If _path_ does not start with the string _jspmPackagesPath_ then,
>    1. Return _undefined_.
> 1. Let _relPackagePath_ be the substring of _path_ starting at the index of the length of _jspmPackagesPath_.
> 1. Let _registrySep_ be the index of the first path separator in _relPackagePath_.
> 1. _If _registrySep_ is not defined then,
>    1. Return _undefined_.
> 1. Let _canonical_ be the result of replacing the character at _registrySep_ with _":"_.
> 1. If running in Windows then,
>    1. Replace in _canonical_ any instance of _"\\"_ with _"/"_.
> 1. If _canonical_ does not contain a zero-indexed substring matching the package name regular expression then,
>    1. Return _undefined_.
> 1. Let _name_ be the unique substring of _canonical_ starting from the first character, matched against the package name regular expression.
> 1. Let _path_ be the substring of _canonical_ from the index of the length of _name_.
> 1. If _path_ is defined and _path_ does not start with _"/"_ then,
>    1. Return _undefined_.
> 1. Return the object with values _{ name, path }_.

> **PACKAGE_TO_PATH(name: String, path: String, jspmPackagesPath: String): String**
> 1. Assert _jspmPackagesPath_ is a valid file system path.
> 1. Assert _jspmPackagesPath_ ends with the path segment _"jspm_packages"_.
> 1. Assert _name_ satisfies the valid package name regular expression.
> 1. Assert _path_ is empty or it does not start with _"/"_.
> 1. Replace in _name_ the first _":"_ character with the file system path separator.
> 1. If running in Windows then,
>    1. Replace any instance of _"/"_ in _name_ with _"\\"_.
>    1. Replace any instance of _"/"_ in _path_ with _"\\"_.
> 1. Return the result of the path resolution of _"${name}${path}"_ within parent _jspmPackagesParent_.

The parse functions return undefined if not a valid package canonical name form, while the package to URL function must
always be called against a valid package canonical name form.

These methods are designed to work on paths within the canonicals (`PACKAGE_TO_PATH(npm:@scope/x@v, /y.js)` -> `/path/to/jspm_packages/npm/@scope/x@v/y.js`).

### Reading Configuration

For a given module we need to know its jspm configuration from reading both the `package.json` and `jspm.json` files.

This can be handled by a get configuration function along the following lines:

> **GET_JSPM_CONFIG(modulePath: String)**
> 1. Let _parentPaths_ be the array of parent paths of _modulePath_ ordered by length decreasing, excluding a trailing separator.
> 1. For each _path_ of _parentPaths_,
>    1. If the last path segment of _path_ is equal to _"node_modules"_ then,
>       1. Return _undefined_.
>    1. If _path_ contains a _"jspm_packages"_ path segment then,
>       1. Let _jspmSubpath_ be the substring of _path_ from the first index to the end of the instance of the _"jspm_packages"_ segment.
>       1. Let _parsedPackage_ be the value of _PARSE_PACKAGE_PATH(path, jspmSubpath)_.
>       1. If _parsedPackage_ is _undefined_ or _parsedPackage.path_ is equal to the empty string then,
>          1. Continue the loop.
>    1. If the file at _"package.json"_ within the folder _path_ does not exist then,
>       1. Continue the loop.
>    1. Let _pjson_ be set to the output of the JSON parser applied to the contents of _"package.json"_ in _path_, throwing a _Configuration Error_ on invalid JSON.
>    1. Let _jspmConfigPath_ be the resolved path of _"jspm.json"_ within parent folder _path_.
>    1. If _pjson.configFiles?.jspm_ is a relative URL without backtracking,
>       1. Set _jspmConfigPath_ to the path resolution of _pjson.configFiles.jspm_ to _path_.
>    1. Let _jspmConfig_ be set to _undefined_.
>    1. If the file at _jspmConfigPath_ exists,
>       1. Set _jspmConfig_ to the output of the JSON parser applied to the contents of _jspmConfigPath_, throwing a _Configuration Error_ on invalid JSON.
>    1. If _jspmConfig_ is not _undefined_ then,
>       1. Let _jspmPackagesPath_ be set to the resolved path of _"jspm_packages/"_ within parent folder _path_.
>       1. If _jspmPackagesPath_ does not exist then,
>          1. Set _jspmPackagesPath_ to the global environment jspm packages path.
>       1. Let _basePath_ be set to _path_.
>       1. If _pjson.directories?.lib is a relative path without backtracking,
>          1. Set _basePath_ to the path resolution of _pjson.directories.lib_ to _path_.
>       1. If _pjson.directories?.dist is a relative path without backtracking,
>          1. If the environment conditional _production_ is _true_,
>             1. Set _basePath_ to the path resolution of _pjson.directories.dist_ to _path_.
>       1. If _basePath_ has a trailing path separator, then remove it.
>       1. If _basePath_ is equal to or a subpath of _jspmPackagesPath_ then,
>          1. Set _basePath_ to _path_.
>       1. Return the object with values _{ jspmConfig, jspmPackagesPath, basePath }_.

The return value of the above method is either `undefined` or an object of the form `{ jspmConfig, jspmPackagesPath, basePath }`.

### Matching and Applying Map Resolution

jspm configurations use resolve maps to match a plain name and direct it to a new module name.
Matching a map is based on finding the longest map target that matches the start of the plain name.

Map configurations in the jspm configurations also support conditional objects which represent map branches based
on environment conditionals.

Match boundaries are taken to be the `/` separator or the end of the name. In this way the map `{ 'x/y': 'z' }` can match both `x/y` and `x/y/path`.

Main maps are also supported via the map of `{ '.': './main.js' }`, and are handled to work out correctly, while not matching `./`.

Applying the map is then the process of adding back the subpath after the match (`x/y/path` mapping into `z/path` for the `{ 'x/y': 'z' }` map), including support for condition branches:

> **APPLY_MAP(name: String, resolveMap: Object)**
> 1. Assert _IS_RELATIVE(name)_ or _IS_PLAIN(name)_.
> 1. Let _match_ be set to _undefined_.
> 1. Let _parentNames_ be the set of parent paths of _name_ (_"/"_ separated), including _name_ itself, in descending order (each item without the last separated segment from the previous one and without a trailing separator).
> 1. If the last item of _parentNames_ is the string _"."_ then,
>    1. If this is the only item of _parentNames_ and _resolveMap["."]_ is not _undefined_ then,
>       1. Set _match_ to _"."_.
>    1. Otherwise, remove the last item from _parentNames_.
> 1. If _match_ is not _undefined_ then,
>    1. For each _parentName_ of _parentNames_,
>       1. If _resolveMap_ has an entry for _parentName_ then,
>          1. Set _match_ to _parentName_.
>          1. Break the loop.
> 1. If _match_ is _undefined_ then,
>    1. Return _undefined_.
> 1. If _IS_RELATIVE(match)_ or _IS_PLAIN(match)_ is equal to false then,
>    1. Throw an _Invalid Configuration_ error.
> 1. Let _replacement_ be the value of _resolveMap[match]_.
> 1. If _replacement_ is an _Object_ then,
>    1. For each property _condition_ of _replacement_,
>       1. If _condition_ is the name of an environment conditional that is _true_.
>          1. Set _replacement_ to the value of _replacement[condition]_.
>          1. If _replacement_ is not a _string_ then,
>             1. Throw an _Invalid Configuration_ error.
>          1. Break the loop.
>    1. If _replacement_ is not a _string_,
>       1. Return _undefined_.
> 1. Otherwise, assert _replacement_ is a _string_.
> 1. If _IS_RELATIVE(match)_ then,
>    1. If _IS_RELATIVE(replacement)_ is _false_ and _replacement_ is not equal to _"@empty"_, or if _replacement_ contains any _".."_ or _"."_ path segments from after the second character index then,
>       1. Throw an _Invalid Configuration_ error.
> 1. Otherwise,
>    1. If _IS_RELATIVE(replacement)_ or _IS_PLAIN(replacement)_ is _true_ or _PARSE_PACKAGE_CANONICAL(replacement)_ is _undefined_ then,
>       1. Throw an _Invalid Configuration_ error.
> 1. Return _replacement_ concatenated with the substring of _name_ from the index at the length of _match_ to the end of the string.


### Extension and Directory Index Handling

Like the NodeJS module resolution, jspm 2.0 supports automatic extension and directory index handling.

There is one exception added to this which is that if a path ends in a separator character it is allowed not to resolve at all,
in order to support directory resolution utility functions.

The full algorithm applied to a URL, with this directory addition is:

> **FILE_RESOLVE(path: string)**
> 1. Assert _path_ is a valid file path.
> 1. Let _sep_ be the environment path separator.
> 1. If _path_ ends with the character _sep_ then,
>    1. Return _path_.
> 1. If the file at _path_ exists,
>    1. Return _path_.
> 1. If the file at _"${path}.js"_ exists,
>    1. Return _"${path}.js"_.
> 1. If the file at _"${path}.json"_ exists,
>    1. Return _"${path}.json"_.
> 1. If the file at _"${path}.node"_ exists,
>    1. Return _"${path}.node"_.
> 1. If the file at _"${path}${sep}index.js"_ exists,
>    1. Return _"${path}${sep}index.js"_.
> 1. If the file at _"${path}${sep}index.json"_ exists,
>    1. Return _"${path}${sep}index.json"_.
> 1. If the file at _"${path}${sep}index.node"_ exists,
>    1. Return _"${path}${sep}index.node"_.
> 1. Throw a _Module Not found_ error.

### Module Resolution Algorithm

Module resolution is always based on resolving `resolve(name, parentPath)` where `name` is the optional unresolved
name to resolve and `parentPath` is an absolute file path to resolve relative to.

The resolver is based on two main parts - plain name resolution, and relative resolution.

Plain name resolution runs through contextual package resolution (jspm dependency configurations) and global package resolution
(top-level jspm installs) before falling back to delegating entirely to the `node_modules` NodeJS resolution. If no plain
resolution is in the NodeJS resolution, an error is thrown.

Relative resolution is applied after jspm plain configuration, based on detecting if the parent path is the base project or a package path, and then resolving the relative parent path within the base relative map or relative package map respectively.

When handling conditional resolution, the environment conditional state is required to be known, an object of the form:

```js
{
  browser: boolean,
  node: boolean,
  production: boolean,
  dev: boolean,
  default: true
}
```

Where `production` and `dev` must be mutually exclusive, while `browser` and `node` can both be true for environments like Electron.

Package name requests are supported of the form `registry:name@version[/path]`, as direct imports and as targets of map configurations. A package name request with only a `/` path will return the package name exactly, not applying the main map (`.` map), so that this utility approach can be used to resolve package folders through plain mappings.

There is only one core reserved module name and that is `@empty`, which when used as a plain name or in maps will return `undefined` from the resolver. All other core module name matching needs to be handled outside of this resolver.

The resolver will either return undefined or a resolved path string, or throw a _Module Not Found_, _Invalid Module Name_ or _Invalid Configuration_ error.

Package name requests and plain name requests are both considered unescaped - that is URL decoding will not be applied. URL decoding is only applied to URL-like requests.

The parent pathname is assumed a valid fully-resolved path in the environment, with the exception that `/` in Windows paths is allowed to be converted into `\\` as is the NodeJS convention for resolve. No absolute paths, URLs, URL-encoding, and relative segments are not supported in the parent path.

The resolution algorithm breaks down into the following high-level process to get the fully resolved URL:

> **JSPM_RESOLVE(name: string, parentPath: string)**
> 1. Assert _parentPath_ is a valid absolute file system path.
> 1. Let _config_ be set to _undefined_.
> 1. Let _jspmConfig_, _jspmPackagesPath_, _basePath_ be set to _undefined_.
> 1. If _IS_PLAIN(name)_ then,
>    1. Set _config_ to the result of _GET_JSPM_CONFIG(parentPath)_.

The implementation of `NODE_RESOLVE` is exactly the NodeJS module resolution algorithm, with the following additions:

* NodeJS core module names should not be resolved, and should throw a _Module Not Found_ error.
* The browserify "browser" field should be respected when resolving in the browser environment (including a `false` map returning _undefined_).
* Module names ending in the environment path separator must always throw a not found error.

Full compatility in a module loading pipeline would be formed with a wrapper along the following lines:

> 1. If _name_ is a core module then return _name_.
> 1. If _name_ ends with a _"/"_ character then set _name_ to the substring of _name_ up to the second last character.
> 1. Return the result of _JSPM_RESOLVE(name, parentUrl)_, propagating any error on abrupt completion.
